# Compiler to a self-defined language
Project for course Compilation Techniques at Warsaw University of Technology.

Project focused on creating a compiler for a custom programming language.
Consists of a lexer, parser and interpreter.
The language has to allow description of points and
line segments on the surface. Points and line segments are built-in types 
of the language. There should be a possibility to build geometric figures 
from the line segments and a collection of figures should create 
a scene later displayed on the screen.
